  - `title`: Paper title.
  - `authors`: List of author names.
  - `summary`: Abstract of the paper.
  - `published`: ISO8601 formatted publication date.

- **Outputs:**  
  A list of absolute file paths (strings) where the PDFs have been saved locally.
- **Flow:**  
  - For each paper, a safe filename is generated from the title.  
  - Files are grouped into subfolders by `primary_category`.  
  - If a filename already exists, a numerical suffix is appended to avoid conflicts.  
  - After downloading, return the local paths of all saved PDFs.
- **Note:** You need to ask the user before executing this tool!
